    """
    HydraLoRA: MoE-style multi-head LoRA with layer-local routing.
    Shared lora_down captures common features; per-expert lora_up heads specialize.
    Each module owns its own router that reads the layer input and emits per-sample gates,
    so specialization is learned per-layer rather than globally.
    Reference: docs/methods/hydra-lora.md

    Optional σ-conditional routing (Track B, timestep-hydra.md): when
    ``sigma_feature_dim > 0``, ``sinusoidal(σ)`` is **concatenated** to the
    pooled rank-R router input, making ``self.router`` a
    ``Linear(r + sigma_feat, E)``. The σ-feature columns of the router
    weight are zero-init, so step-0 behavior is identical to the no-σ router
    and σ-dependence only emerges as those columns accumulate gradient.

    Why direct-input rather than the previous additive-bias ``sigma_mlp``: a
    bias-only σ path's gradient is ``dL/d logits · d_sigma_feat``, which
    vanishes whenever experts are undifferentiated (all ``score_e`` near
    equal → ``dL/d logit_e ≈ 0``). Feeding σ into the router's input avoids
    this chicken-and-egg problem — the σ columns train alongside the
    content columns on the same chain rule, so σ routing emerges as soon as
    the router learns anything at all.

    ``use_global_router`` (shared_A + ``route_per_layer=False`` path): the
    per-layer router is dropped and gates are read from a ``_routing_weights``
    buffer broadcast in from the network-level ``GlobalRouter``. The shared
    ``lora_down`` + per-expert ``lora_up`` layout is unchanged — only the
    gating source moves. σ-band partition is incompatible with this path
    (the partition rewrites local logits and there are no local logits to
    rewrite). Balance loss is silently inert in this mode: ``_last_gate``
    is the detached buffer broadcast, so ``get_balance_loss`` contributes a
    constant with no gradient signal back to the GlobalRouter.
