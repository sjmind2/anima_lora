# ChimeraHydra: dual-pool additive MoE on the OrthoHydra Cayley parameterization.
#
# See ``docs/proposal/chimera_hydra.md``. Two pools of B-heads share one A per
# adapted Linear — a **content** pool routed by the local rank-R router (input:
# pooled ``lx``), and a **frequency** pool routed by the network-level
# ``FreqRouter`` (input: FEI + sinusoidal-σ features). The full gate
# ``[π_c | π_f]`` is fed into the existing OrthoHydra einsum, so the
# additive composition ``Σ π_c · B_c (Ax) + Σ π_f · B_f (Ax)`` falls out of
# the same shared code path — pools are disjoint by name only.
#
# T-LoRA composition: ``use_timestep_mask`` applies the rank mask to the
# **content branch only** — the freq branch sees full rank at every t (high-σ
# steps are exactly where the freq pool wants coarse-stage capacity, while
# the content pool is the layout/identity memorization risk surface).
# Implemented with two bmm calls.
