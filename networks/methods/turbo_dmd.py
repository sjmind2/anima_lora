"""Turbo Anima — DP-DMD distillation harness.

Owns two plain ``LoRANetwork`` instances (student + fake) on one frozen Anima
DiT. Both call ``apply_to(unet)`` which chains them onto every targeted
Linear's forward — at runtime the chain order is::

    linear(x) -> fake.forward -> student.forward -> original_linear.forward

Each LoRA module short-circuits at ``not self.enabled`` (see
``lora_modules/lora.py::LoRAModule.forward``), so view-toggling is just
``set_enabled(bool)`` on each network — O(num_modules) Python loop, negligible
vs a DiT forward.

Used by ``scripts/distill_turbo/distill.py``. Inference loads the saved
``anima_turbo.safetensors`` through the standard LoRA path (no inference-side
turbo code) — the student LoRA is just a normal LoRA with CFG=4 baked in.

This harness is method-agnostic (two view-toggled LoRA stacks); the shipped
objective driving it is DP-DMD.

Docs: ``docs/structure/dpdmd.md`` (structure), ``docs/experimental/dpdmd.md`` (ops).

Distillation" (arXiv:2602.03139).

    """Pooled-token GAN head over frozen-teacher block features (FastGen v0).

    FastGen's ``Discriminator_ImageDiT`` un-flattens each tapped block's tokens
    back to ``(B, D, H_p, W_p)`` and runs a conv head. Under Anima's native-shape
    bucketing the patch grid is per-bucket and, with ``compile_blocks``, the block
    output is the fake-5D ``(B, 1, L, 1, D)`` layout — so the spatial reshape is
    the fragile part the proposal flags. This v0 sidesteps it: **mean-pool each
    tap's token output over every axis between batch and channel** → ``(B, D)``,
    then a 2-layer MLP per tap → a per-tap logit. The pool is shape-agnostic, so
    it works identically on the eager ``(B, T, H, W, D)`` grid and the compiled
    ``(B, 1, L, 1, D)`` layout. Logits for all taps are concatenated to
    ``(B, num_taps)``; runs in fp32 for GAN-loss stability.

    Tiny by design (~``inner_dim²/2`` params/tap, ≈2M at D=2048) and discarded at
    save — pure training scaffolding, exactly like the fake/critic LoRA.
