# Changes from sd-scripts for torch.compile / dynamo

This document catalogues every change made to the `anima_lora` fork (relative to the original `sd-scripts` repo) that enables or supports `torch.compile` and PyTorch dynamo. Changes are grouped by file and subsystem.

---

## 1. Attention dispatch (`networks/attention_dispatch.py`)

### 1.1 Flash Attention 4 graph breaks

FA4's CUTLASS/TVM kernels access raw DLPack data pointers, which fail with FakeTensors during dynamo tracing. Since FA4 is already a fused kernel that `torch.compile` cannot improve, we wrap it with `@torch.compiler.disable` to insert clean graph breaks while letting surrounding ops compile normally.

```python
# NEW
@torch.compiler.disable
def flash_attn_4_func(*args, **kwargs):
    out, _lse = _flash_attn_4_func_raw(*args, **kwargs)
    return out

@torch.compiler.disable
def flash_attn_4_varlen_func(*args, **kwargs):
    out, _lse = _flash_attn_4_varlen_func_raw(*args, **kwargs)
    return out
```

**sd-scripts**: No FA4 support at all.

> Note: FA4 is currently not the default attention backend — see [`fa4.md`](fa4.md) for why. The code paths remain in place for re-enabling.

### 1.2 Flex attention: NOT pre-compiled

When blocks are individually compiled (`compile_blocks` / native-flatten mode), the outer `torch.compile` already traces into `flex_attention` and fuses it. Pre-compiling causes nested compilation that exhausts dynamo's recompile limit (`grad_mode` guard x mask variants) and falls back to the slow unfused path.

```python
# NEW — intentionally NOT compiled
compiled_flex_attention = _flex_attention  # raw, not torch.compile(...)
```

**sd-scripts**: No flex attention support.

### 1.3 Flex attention early-return path

New first-class `"flex"` attention mode with pre-computed `BlockMask` support for the cross-attention padding mask. This avoids data-dependent control flow that would cause graph breaks. (The self-attention `BlockMask` only ever served the retired static-pad path; native shapes have no padded self-attn KV, so `selfattn_block_mask` stays `None`.)

### 1.4 New AttentionParams fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `softmax_scale` | Custom softmax scale passed through to all backends (avoids per-call branching) |
| `crossattn_block_mask` | Pre-computed BlockMask for the cross-attention padding mask (flex mode) |
| `selfattn_block_mask` | Unused in native mode (no padded self-attn KV); stays `None` |

### 1.5 LSE sink correction for trimmed cross-attention (flash4 — removed)

The KV-trim + LSE-sigmoid correction path was bundled with FA4 and depended on FA4's `return_lse`. Both FA4 and the trim plumbing were removed (the `crossattn_full_len` field and the `_KV_BUCKETS` constant are gone as of 2026-05-20). See `docs/optimizations/fa4.md` for the postmortem; reviving it now means reimplementing the trim, not uncommenting it.

When the path was active, zero-padded KV positions were trimmed and the softmax denominator restored via:

```python
correction = torch.sigmoid(lse - math.log(n_pad))
x = out * correction.transpose(1, 2).unsqueeze(-1)
```

---

## 2. Model architecture (`library/anima/models.py`)

### 2.1 Removed `einops.rearrange`

`einops.rearrange` uses string-based symbolic shape parsing that is opaque to dynamo. All uses replaced with explicit tensor operations:

| Original (einops) | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `rearrange(t, "b ... (h d) -> b ... h d", h=..., d=...)` | `.unflatten(-1, (n_heads, head_dim))` |
| `rearrange(x, "B T H W (p1 p2 t C) -> B C (T t) (H p1) (W p2)", ...)` | `.unflatten().permute().reshape()` chain |
| `rearrange(em, "t h w d -> (t h w) 1 1 d")` | `.flatten(0, 2).unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(1)` |
| `rearrange(shift, "b t d -> b t 1 1 d")` | `shift[:, :, None, None, :]` |

### 2.2 Removed `torch.autocast` context managers

Context managers introduce overhead and are difficult for dynamo to trace through. Removed from:

- **RMSNorm.forward**: replaced `with torch.autocast(...)` with direct `.float()` / `.to(x.dtype)` casts.
- **FinalLayer.forward**: removed `use_fp32` parameter and autocast wrapping entirely.

### 2.3 `.repeat()` → `.expand()`

`expand()` creates a view without allocating memory, while `repeat()` copies data. In `VideoRopePosition3DEmb.prepare_embedded_sequence`:

```python
# OLD
padding_mask.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, n_heads, 1)
# NEW
padding_mask.unsqueeze(2).expand(-1, -1, n_heads)
```

### 2.4 KV bucket trimming constants (removed)

`_KV_BUCKETS` trimmed cross-attention KV sequences to the smallest fitting bucket, capping `torch.compile` shape variants. It was tied to the FA4-only trim path and was removed along with it (2026-05-20). Cross-attention now runs the full 512-length KV under FA2. See `docs/optimizations/fa4.md`.

### 2.5 `compile_blocks(backend="inductor")` — the single switch

`compile_blocks` is the one call that turns on `torch.compile`. It does two coupled things and raises the dynamo cache-size budget itself:

1. **Native-shape flattening (`self._native_flatten = True`).** The forward flattens each bucket's patch grid `(B, T, H, W, D)` to a fake-5D `(B, 1, seq_len, 1, D)` shape (`unflatten`-restored after the block loop). This keys the block graph on **token count alone** — the shipped `CONSTANT_TOKEN_BUCKETS` collapses to **two** token-count families (4032 and 4200) — instead of guarding `H` and `W` separately (one graph per resolution, 24 buckets). No padding, so flash self-attention sees no padded tokens. Bit-exact to the eager 5D path; eager (uncompiled) forwards leave the flag `False` and skip the reshape.

2. **Per-block compile.** Compiles each block's `_forward` method:
   ```python
   for block in self.blocks:
       block._forward = torch.compile(block._forward, backend=backend, dynamic=False)
   ```
   **Critical:** compiles `_forward` (the actual attention/MLP), NOT `forward` (the checkpointing wrapper). The gradient checkpointing decorator (`unsloth_checkpoint`) uses `@torch._disable_dynamo`, which would cause an immediate graph break if `forward` itself were compiled — dynamo compiles nothing useful but still checks shape guards, causing recompile storms.

The cache budget is `cache_size_limit = max(current, 2*n + 8)` where `n` is the number of token-count families (2): the `2*` covers fwd+bwd sharing the one `_forward` bytecode, the `+8` covers requires_grad / stride specializations. The `max()` lets a multi-resolution caller (e.g. SPD distill, whose downsampled stages produce more distinct shapes) pre-raise the limit without `compile_blocks` lowering it.

There is no padded mode anymore. The legacy `set_static_token_count(count, pad=True)` path zero-padded every bucket up to a single shape, but it leaked padded tokens into flash self-attention (AdaLN shift + Q/K/V bias make zero-input padded rows emit non-trivial K/V; up to ~6.5% rel-L2 on the 4032 buckets) and couldn't even run the shipped table (4200 > the legacy 4096 target → truncation). It was removed 2026-05-24 along with `compile_core` / `--compile_mode full`, `static_token_count`, `static_pad`, and the flex self-attn pad-mask.

---

## 3. Datasets (`library/datasets/`)

### 3.1 Constant-token buckets (`buckets.py`)

`CONSTANT_TOKEN_BUCKETS` — 24 predefined `(W, H)` resolutions grouped into **two token-count families**, 4032 (= 63·64) and 4200 (= 60·70). Each resolution *exactly* fills its family's count, so there is **zero intra-bucket padding** by construction. Native shapes are the only mode: every forward runs at its real token count, so `compile_blocks`' flatten makes `torch.compile` trace one block graph per distinct count — just **two** for this table.

```python
CONSTANT_TOKEN_BUCKETS = [
    # ---- 4032-token family (63*64) ----
    (1008, 1024),   # 63 x 64, ar 0.98 (nearest to square)
    (1024, 1008),   #          ar 1.02
    (896, 1152),    # 56 x 72, ar 0.78
    # ... 9 more landscape/portrait pairs
    (2016, 512),    # 32 x 126, ar 3.94
    # ---- 4200-token family (60*70) ----
    (960, 1120),    # 60 x 70, ar 0.86
    # ... 11 more landscape/portrait pairs
    (1920, 560),    # 35 x 120, ar 3.43
]
```

Two families instead of one because a single count's divisors near √N are sparse (4032 alone jumps aspect 1.29→1.75); interleaving 4032 and 4200 densely covers aspect space at the cost of one extra graph. Note this diverges from `DCW_ASPECT_BUCKETS`: the 832×1248 / 1248×832 HD pair (4056 tokens) is no longer a training bucket.

`BucketManager.make_buckets()` accepts `constant_token_buckets=True` to use these instead of dynamically generated resolutions.

### 3.2 Incomplete batch dropping (`base.py`)

Incomplete last batches are dropped (integer division instead of ceiling) to keep the batch dimension constant across epochs. This prevents `torch.compile` recompilation from a trailing partial batch.

```python
# When no sample_ratio: drop incomplete last batch
batch_count = len(bucket) // self.batch_size
```

Skipped when `sample_ratio < 1.0` (where every image matters more).

---

## 4. Training script (`train.py`)

### 4.1 Block-level compilation

```python
if args.torch_compile:
    model.compile_blocks(args.dynamo_backend, mode=getattr(args, "compile_inductor_mode", None))
```

`compile_blocks` is the only compile path: it enables native-shape flattening and compiles each block individually (never a full-graph compile of the DiT).

### 4.2 Dynamo backend routing (`library/runtime/accelerator.py`)

```python
# Always "NO": torch.compile is applied per-block by compile_blocks. Letting
# Accelerate full-compile on top would double-compile / graph-break.
dynamo_backend = "NO"
```

**sd-scripts**: Always passes `dynamo_backend` to Accelerator when `torch_compile` is set.

### 4.3 Padding mask caching

Padding masks are cached by `(batch_size, h, w, dtype, device)` key to avoid re-allocation every step:

```python
padding_mask_key = (bs, h_latent, w_latent, weight_dtype, accelerator.device)
padding_mask = self._padding_mask_cache.get(padding_mask_key)
```

### 4.4 `constant_token_buckets` plumbed to dataset config

```python
constant_token_buckets=True,  # native constant-token bucketing is the only mode
```

Passed through `library/config/` to `BucketManager.make_buckets()`.

---

## 5. LoRA networks (`networks/lora_anima/`)

### 5.1 `_orig_mod_` key stripping

`torch.compile` wraps modules in `_orig_mod` containers, inserting `_orig_mod.` or `_orig_mod_` into state-dict keys. Three locations handle this:

1. **`create_network_from_weights()`** — strips keys when loading external checkpoints.
2. **Module discovery loop** — strips `_orig_mod.` from module paths during LoRA target matching.
3. **`_strip_orig_mod_keys()` static method + `load_state_dict()` override** — ensures any state-dict loaded into the network is normalized.

```python
@staticmethod
def _strip_orig_mod_keys(state_dict):
    new_sd = {}
    for key, val in state_dict.items():
        new_key = re.sub(r"(?<=_)_orig_mod_", "", key)
        new_sd[new_key] = val
    return new_sd

def load_state_dict(self, state_dict, strict=True, **kwargs):
    state_dict = self._strip_orig_mod_keys(state_dict)
    return super().load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=strict, **kwargs)
```

**sd-scripts**: Zero `_orig_mod_` awareness — loading a checkpoint trained with `torch.compile` would fail.

### 5.2 Memory-saving down-projection autograd (`networks/lora_modules/custom_autograd.py`)

The LoRA down projection runs its matmul in fp32 for accumulation precision:

```python
lx = F.linear(x_lora.float(), self.lora_down.weight.float())
```

`F.linear`'s backward saves the exact forward input, so the `.float()` upcast of `x` is retained across the fwd→bwd window as an fp32 tensor (4 B / elem). At a ~4096-token bucket this is 32 MiB per 2048-wide Linear and 128 MiB for the 8192-wide MLP `layer2` input; accumulated across 28 DiT blocks × ~5–6 adapted Linears per block this was the largest single source of LoRA-side activation VRAM.

The fix is a targeted activation-recompute trick: a custom `torch.autograd.Function` that saves the low-precision `x` (bf16, 2 B / elem) and recomputes `x.float()` (or `(x * inv_scale).float()`) in backward. The fp32 bottleneck matmul is preserved in both directions, so gradients are bitwise-identical to the legacy path for deterministic kernels.

**Relevant to compile:** the feature uses **two separate `autograd.Function` subclasses** (scaled and unscaled), not one with an optional tensor. This keeps the graph shape fixed — no shape-dependent Python branches, no optional-tensor sentinels that could cause guard churn:

```python
class LoRADownProjectFn(torch.autograd.Function):       # no channel-scale
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x, weight):
        out = F.linear(x.float(), weight.float())
        ctx.save_for_backward(x, weight)                # bf16 x saved, not x.float()
        return out

class ScaledLoRADownProjectFn(torch.autograd.Function): # with channel-scale
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x, weight, inv_scale):
        x_work = x * inv_scale
        out = F.linear(x_work.float(), weight.float())
        ctx.save_for_backward(x, weight, inv_scale)
        return out

def lora_down_project(x, weight, inv_scale):            # dispatch at module init
    if inv_scale is None:
        return LoRADownProjectFn.apply(x, weight)
    return ScaledLoRADownProjectFn.apply(x, weight, inv_scale)
```

Each adapted LoRA module carries a boolean attribute `use_custom_down_autograd` set once by the network factory — Dynamo sees a static Python branch inside `forward`, not a runtime dispatch.

Wired through `LoRAModule`, `HydraLoRAModule`, `OrthoLoRAModule`, `OrthoHydraLoRAModule`, and `ChimeraHydraLoRAModule`. The Ortho/Chimera variants pass `Q_eff = R_q @ Q_basis` as the "weight" argument — autograd returns `grad_Q_eff`, which the existing graph propagates into `S_q` unchanged; Chimera issues two such calls (one per pool) on a shared rebalanced `x_in`, deduping the saved-for-backward input. ReFT (block-level intervention) and Conv2d LoRA are intentionally out of scope and take the legacy path.

**Measured (60-step A/B under `torch.compile`, default stack):** loss/average matched within 0.7 % (run-to-run noise), per-step loss statistically indistinguishable at z = +1.84, wall/step matched within 0.4 %, peak VRAM dropped ~4 GiB. The wall-clock parity is the compile-relevant signal: if Dynamo had broken the graph at each LoRA-patched Linear (once per `autograd.Function.apply`), kernel-launch overhead across 28 × ~5–6 sites would have erased the memory win. It didn't.

**sd-scripts**: No equivalent — plain `F.linear(x.float(), ...)` retains the fp32 cast unconditionally.

**Default-on:** `use_custom_down_autograd = true` lives in `configs/base.toml` and is on for every method. Opt out per run with `--network_args use_custom_down_autograd=false` if the legacy path is needed for debugging.

---

## 6. LoRA utils (`networks/lora_utils.py`)

Same `_orig_mod_` normalization applied during LoRA weight merging:

```python
# Strip _orig_mod_ from LoRA keys (inserted by torch.compile during training)
for k, v in lora_sd.items():
    normalized[k.replace("__orig_mod_", "_")] = v
```

---

## 7. Config (`library/train_util.py` dataset blueprint path)

`generate_dataset_group_by_blueprint()` accepts a new `constant_token_buckets: bool` parameter, forwarded to `dataset.make_buckets()`.

---

## 8. CLI arguments

### Changed behavior

| Argument | sd-scripts | anima_lora |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| `--torch_compile` | Full-graph via Accelerator | Per-block via `compile_blocks` (native-shape flatten); never full-graph |
| `--dynamo_backend` | Always forwarded to Accelerator | Forwarded to `compile_blocks`; Accelerate's own dynamo stays `"NO"` |

---

## Summary: the compilation strategy

The key insight is that a DiT training loop has three sources of shape dynamism that trigger `torch.compile` recompilation:

1. **Spatial resolution** — different bucket sizes produce different `(T, H, W)` token counts.
2. **Caption length** — variable text encoder output lengths for cross-attention KV.
3. **Batch size** — trailing incomplete batches at epoch boundaries.

The fork eliminates all three:

| Source | Solution | Files |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Spatial resolution | `CONSTANT_TOKEN_BUCKETS` + `compile_blocks` native-shape flatten (graph keys on token count) | `buckets.py`, `library/anima/models.py` |
| Caption length | Text encoder output zero-padded to a fixed 512-token KV (sink padding) | `library/anima/strategy.py`, `library/anima/models.py` |
| Batch size | Drop incomplete last batches | `library/datasets/base.py` |

With shapes stabilized, `compile_blocks()` compiles each block's `_forward` with `dynamic=False` — the inductor backend generates optimized kernels once per token-count family (two) and reuses them for every step.
