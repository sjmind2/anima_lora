"""Caption-source helpers used by the tagger CLI build/eval modes.

Tag-taxonomy / caption-format constants (``SLOT_ORDER``, ``TAG_TYPE_NAMES``,
``RATINGS``, ``PEOPLE_COUNT_LABELS``) are the single source of truth for the
trainer's view of the corpus and live in
``library/captioning/anima_tagger.py`` so the inference wrapper, training CLI,
and any downstream consumer all see the same definitions. The script-local
helpers below (caption-file discovery, count-tag detection, people-count
bucketing) consume those constants.

      exact-boys-no-girl combos

      ``3+boys``, ``2girls+2+boys``, ``Nothers``, or a ``multiple_*`` tag
      with no explicit numeric companion. ``others`` count tags ride into
      ``multi`` since the head is girls/boys-shaped.

    Booru auto-fires ``multiple_girls`` / ``multiple_boys`` whenever the
    count is ≥2, not just ≥3 — so it cannot be treated as a ≥3 signal on
    its own. We defer to the explicit numeric count tag when one is
    present; ``multiple_*`` only contributes as a floor of 2 when no
    numeric tag for that gender was seen.

    Tag order in ``tags`` doesn't matter — counts are reduced first.
