"""The job manager: FIFO serial queue + worker thread + state table.

One worker thread drains a ``queue.Queue`` of job ids. Per job it builds the
same ``accelerate launch … train.py`` command the CLI builds, spawns it
detached (so a console ctrl-C can't reach it), points ``--progress_jsonl`` at
the job dir, then monitors by polling ``(pid, create_time)`` liveness — never
by awaiting a subprocess transport (sidesteps Windows ProactorEventLoop
subprocess bugs). On boot it reconciles ``jobs/`` so it can re-attach a
still-alive orphan or mark a dead one ``orphaned``.

Serial by design (single local GPU): exactly one job runs at a time.
