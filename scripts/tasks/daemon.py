"""CLI surface for the local training daemon (``make daemon*``).

Four verbs, mapped to the lifecycle guarantees in ``plan.md`` Phase 1:

    daemon            start (idempotent — no-op if already up), wait /health
    daemon-attach     non-owning viewer; ctrl-C detaches only, training lives on
    daemon-kill       abort the running (or JOB=<id>) job, free GPU; daemon stays up
    daemon-terminate  shut the whole daemon down (active job dies too)

``daemon`` starts the daemon **console-detached** (see ``proc.spawn_detached``),
so the terminal's SIGINT reaches only the foreground group, never the daemon.
``daemon-attach`` is the parent of nothing, so its ctrl-C can't touch training.
Both teardown verbs verify the pidfile's ``(pid, create_time)`` before acting so
they never touch a PID-reused stranger.
