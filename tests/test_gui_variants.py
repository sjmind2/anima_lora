"""Tests for the Track 2 GUI variant registry (``configs/gui-methods/*.toml``).

Built-in variants are discovered from each file's ``[variant]`` metadata
table (see ``gui/__init__.py``). This module pins:

* every built-in is loadable via ``load_method_preset(..., methods_subdir="gui-methods")``
* every built-in carries a ``[variant].family`` string
* no built-in surfaces a retired router knob as a TOML key
* output_name is unique across built-ins, with one explicit exception:
  the plain ``lora`` family ships three hardware/length variants that all
  bake to the same ``"anima"`` adapter on purpose.

Customs under ``configs/gui-methods/custom/`` are intentionally exempt —
users name and structure those freely.
