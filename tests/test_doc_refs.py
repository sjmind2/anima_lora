"""Guard that tracked docs don't drift from the live tree.

``scripts/check_docs.py`` is a standalone CLI linter, but nothing ran it
automatically — so a doc could reference a deleted file or a renamed ``make``
target and nobody would notice. This pins its **ERROR** classes (broken repo
paths + unknown ``make`` targets) as a hard test: the live tree must be clean.

CLI *flags* are deliberately WARN-only in the linter (the known-flag set is
permissive on purpose — see its module docstring), so this suite does not fail
on them. We only assert the two ERROR classes, plus a few unit checks so the
guard can't silently pass because the detector itself broke.
